# Physiological Simulation Data Analysis Tool

A simple web-based tool to help researchers and educators analyze **physiology simulation data**.  
It transforms Excel spreadsheets into clear, interactive charts for easier insight generation and communication.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Import Excel Files** – load simulation data from `.xlsx` (all tabs automatically imported).
- **Add Metadata** – record TBSA %, fluid regimen, time since injury, model version.
- **Explore Graphs** – interactive line, scatter, and bar charts.
- **Compare Simulations** – overlay or view side-by-side.
- **See Normal Ranges** – shaded zones for reference values (HR, MAP, urine output).
- **Add Notes** – document observations directly in the tool.
- **Export Results** – save high-quality PNG images or full reports.
- **Save Sessions** – continue your analysis later (local storage, no cloud).

## 👩‍🔬 Who It’s For

- **Researchers**: Validate models and compare treatments.
- **Educators**: Use simulation data to teach physiology.
- **Clinicians/Advisors**: Review exported results without technical setup.

## 📷 Example Workflow

1. Upload your `.xlsx` file.
2. Enter metadata (e.g., 20% TBSA, Parkland regimen, fluids given).
3. Choose variables (e.g., MAP + HR).
4. Overlay simulations for comparison.
5. Add comments when physiology deviates from expected.
6. Export your charts as images or reports.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local-only storage**: all data stays in your browser.
- **No cloud uploads**: secure for sensitive research data.
